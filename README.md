## Getting Started with Node JS
- Now that we understand why Node.js is a great choice for building backends let's get started with the technical details.

## Install Node JS & npm
- The first step is to install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your machine. You can download the latest version of Node.js from their official website. Once installed, you can verify the installation by running the following commands in your terminal:

`node -v npm -v`

## Set up a new Node.js project
- Next, we need to set up a new Node.js project. Create a new folder for your project and navigate to it in your terminal. Then, run the following command to initialize a new Node.js
project:

`npm init`
This will create a package.json file, which will contain information about your project and its dependencies.

## Install Express.js for Creating a Web Server
- Express.js is a popular Node.js framework for building web applications. It provides a simple and intuitive API for creating web servers and handling HTTP requests. To install Express.js, run the following command in your terminal:
